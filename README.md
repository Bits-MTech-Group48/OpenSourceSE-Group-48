## About Selenium Scripts

Selenium is a portable framework for testing web applications. ... It also provides a test domain-specific language (Selenese) to write tests in a number of popular programming languages, including C#, Groovy, Java, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby and Scala. The tests can then run against most modern web browsers.

Selenium WebDriver
If you want to create robust, browser-based regression automation suites and tests, scale and distribute scripts across many environments, then you want to use Selenium WebDriver, a collection of language specific bindings to drive a browser - the way it is meant to be driven.

The source code, documentation, roadmap, issue tracker, testing, benchmarks are all public.

More information is available at https://www.selenium.dev/.
